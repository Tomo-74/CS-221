Read over the SimpleSet Interface and the ArraySet Class. Briefly looked at the SetTester Class.
Ran the SetTester Class (without changing any code). INITIAL RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 51 of 111, Passed: 32,
Failed: 19'. This is a much better result than I expected to get from the initial run. This is probably because we 
were given a good toString method, whereas the one demonstrated in class was broken

Added breakpoint on SetTester line 153 (the emptySet_addA_A_testRemoveB() method). Stepped into emptySet_addA_A().
Stepped into the remove() method. The first while loop was being skipped when it shouldn't have been. Stepped into the add()
method and added the statement 'rear++;' at the end, after a new element was added. Restarted the debugger and stepped into
the remove() method to test if my change solved the problem. The first while loop is now entered because 'i < rear == true'.
This means my change solved the (first) bug. NEW RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 93 of 111,  Passed: 82,  Failed: 11'

Added breakpoint on SetTester line 299 (problematic method is AB_removeA_B()). Stepped into the AB_removeA_B()
method. Stepped into the remove() method. Noticed that the second while loop was causing an IndexOutOfBounds
Exception when shifting the set elements forward. Changed the while loop condition to 'i < rear - 1'. This
fixed the second bug. NEW RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 111 of 111,  Passed: 100,  Failed: 11'.

Added breakpoint on SetTester line 111. Stepped into the emptySet() method. Step returned. Stepped into the
testIsEmpty() method. Stepped into the isEmpty() method. Changed the return statement from 'rear > 0' to
'rear == 0'. This fixed the third bug. NEW RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 111 of 111,  Passed: 111,  Failed: 0'.
