Read through the SimpleSet Interface and the ArraySet Class. Briefly looked at the SetTester Class.
Ran the SetTester Class (without changing any code). RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 51 of 111, Passed: 32,
Failed: 19' This is a much better result than I expected to get from the initial run. This is because we 
were given a good toString method, whereas the one demonstrated in class was broken.

Added breakpoint on ArraySet line 81. Stepped into NoSuchElementException Class. Step returned.
Stepped into testRemove() method. Step returned. Moved breakpoint to ArraySet line 64 (beginning of
problematic method. Stepped into the method. Noticed that the first while method is skipped, probably
because of the 'i < rear' condition. Changed it to 'i <= rear'. After doing this, the debugger steps
into the first while loop, but a NullPointerException is still thrown because the ArraySet is empty.
Changed the while loop condition back to 'i < rear'. The test passes. I've been debugging in the wrong
area. I should have set my break point in the SetTester Class.

Added breakpoint on SetTester line 153 (the emptySet_addA_A_testRemoveB() method). Stepped into emptySet_addA_A().
Stepped into the remove() method. The first while loop is being skipped when it shouldn't be. Stepped into the add()
method and incremented 'rear' by 1 when a new element is added. Stepped into the remove() method to test if my 
change solved the problem. The first while loop is now entered because 'i < rear == true'. This solved the
problem and the test now passes. NEW RUN RESULTS: 'Total Tests Run: 93 of 111,  Passed: 82,  Failed: 11'

Set breakpoint on SetTester line 299 (problematic method is AB_removeA_B()).
