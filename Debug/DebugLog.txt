Read through the SimpleSet Interface and the ArraySet Class. Briefly looked at the SetTester Class.
Ran the SetTester Class (without changing any code). Run results: 51/111 tests run (32 passed,
19 failed). This is a much better result than I expected to get from the initial run. Is this
because we were given a good toString method, whereas the one demonstrated in class was broken?
